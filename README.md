# Intera
This is a community-driven platform where users can select their interests across various domains (like tech, sports, movies, etc.). Based on their choices, they are automatically added to relevant interest-based groups where they can connect, chat, and collaborate with like-minded individuals.
The platform helps users connect and interact through:

Interest-based groups to meet people with similar interests

Group chats for sharing ideas and conversations

One-to-one chats for personal connections

Intera aims to transform shared interests into active communities, making it easier for people to discover, connect, and grow together.
